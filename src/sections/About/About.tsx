            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>
                Hi, I am Vinicius Souza. I am an Electronics Engineering Technologist and a self taught programmer. I have always been passionate about solving problems and I found in electronics and programming a place to channel that passion.

                I like learning about new technologies to bring my projects to life and on this portfolio I will try to show my projects and the things that I learned with then. For example, when I was in college I got very involved with the IEEE engineering club where I learned a lot with my pears about different problems in computer science and electronics. The most fun I had at the time definitely came when learning about algorithms & data structures and then later when teaching this subject to new club members. This experience definitely changed my view on how I approach problems.

            <p>
                Nowadays my interests orbit around things like web development, data analysis, and robotics. I like how those technologies give me power to create new things and I also really appreciate how they have very strong online communities.
